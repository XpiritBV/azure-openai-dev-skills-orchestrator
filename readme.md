# CLI Tool

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that provides various functionalities to the users. The tool follows the architectural guidelines of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

## Features

The CLI tool offers the following features:

1. **Feature 1**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed nec purus ac erat fringilla efficitur. Ut dapibus aliquet erat, et tristique nunc fermentum vel.
2. **Feature 2**: Nulla scelerisque, odio et varius congue, orci velit tincidunt massa, nec convallis lacus sapien ut velit. Aliquam erat volutpat.
3. **Feature 3**: Proin semper, nisi eu lobortis ullamcorper, eros ex gravida risus, ut finibus enim mauris sed turpis.
4. **Feature 4**: Etiam maximus, ipsum vitae feugiat ullamcorper, ex ipsum faucibus purus, vitae sodales risus nisi auctor mauris.

## Architecture

The CLI tool follows a modular architecture based on Domain-Driven Design principles. The codebase is organized into the following components:

1. **Domain**: This component contains the core business logic and domain models. It encapsulates the essential concepts and rules of the application domain.
2. **Application**: The application component acts as an orchestrator, coordinating the interactions between different domain models and services. It implements the use cases and provides the main entry points for the CLI tool.
3. **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure component handles the technical details and external dependencies. It includes modules for interacting with databases, file systems, APIs, and other external systems.
4. **Presentation**: The presentation component handles the CLI user interface. It defines the command-line commands, options, and arguments, as well as the output formatting.

The code organization follows a modular structure, with each component having its own directory. The main entry point of the CLI tool is located in the `src/main.ts` file.

## Getting Started

To run the CLI tool locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Run the CLI tool: `npm run start`

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the tool.

## Usage

To use the CLI tool, execute the following command:

```bash
$ cli-tool [command] [options] [arguments]
```

Replace `[command]`, `[options]`, and `[arguments]` with the appropriate values for the desired functionality.

For example, to execute Feature 1, use the following command:

```bash
$ cli-tool feature1 [options]
```

Refer to the available command documentation and options within the CLI tool for more detailed information on each feature.
