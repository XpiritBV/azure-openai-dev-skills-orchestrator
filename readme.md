# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It also includes a set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.

## Features

The calculator app provides the following features:

1. Addition: Allows users to add two numbers together.
2. Subtraction: Allows users to subtract one number from another.
3. Multiplication: Allows users to multiply two numbers.
4. Division: Allows users to divide one number by another.

## Architecture

The calculator app follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to organize the codebase in a structured and maintainable manner. The code is divided into the following main components:

1. **Domain**: This component represents the core logic of the calculator. It includes the calculations and validation rules for the arithmetic operations. The domain objects are designed to be immutable and independent of any specific framework or UI.

2. **Application**: The application layer acts as an intermediary between the UI and the domain. It encapsulates the business logic and provides a set of application services that the UI can interact with. The application layer is responsible for orchestrating the domain objects and performing the requested operations.

3. **UI**: The user interface layer provides the necessary interfaces for users to interact with the calculator app. It can be implemented using a variety of technologies and frameworks, such as a command-line interface, a web-based interface, or a mobile app. The UI layer communicates with the application layer to perform calculations and display the results to the user.

## Unit Tests

The calculator app includes a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the implemented functionality. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases for each arithmetic operation. They ensure that the calculations produce the expected results and handle invalid inputs correctly.

To run the unit tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the unit tests by running `python -m unittest discover`.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application by executing the main script, e.g., `python main.py`.
4. Use the provided user interface to perform arithmetic operations.

Please note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the chosen UI technology and framework.
